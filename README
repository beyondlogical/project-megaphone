### What does the script do?

We popup a notification on your website, depending on which style you chose. The script is only 1kb and served off the cdnjs.com network.

* The script is date activated, and will come online on the 23rd and automatically shut off on the 28th
* We only display the widget for people in 100km radius of Washington DC, based off their IP address
* When a user closes the window it doesn't re-open for another 12 hours
* We are only displaying this to desktop computers, and anyone on mobile devices won't see it
